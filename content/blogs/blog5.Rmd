In this project I looked at usage of the 'Santander' bikes (previously dubbed 'Boris Bikes') in London, from 2011 - 2020.

```{r, setup, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```


```{r load-libraries, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(GGally)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(tidyquant)
library(infer)
library(openintro)
```

First let's load the data.

```{r}
bike <- read_csv(here::here("data", "londonBikes.csv"))

```

I'm interested in looking at bike usage over time, however the data set only includes a singular column with the date. For my analysis, I will need to look usage by year, month, day and day of the week. In order to do this, we use the `lubridate` package to convert our `date` variable into these new variables.

```{r}
# Fix dates using lubridate, and generate new variables for year, month, month_name, day, and day_of_week
bike <- bike %>%   
  mutate(
    date=dmy(date),
    year=year(date),
    month = month(date),
    month_name=month(date, label = TRUE),
    day = day(date),
    day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE)) 
```

Now let's look at how usage varies by season.

```{r}
# generate new variable season_name to turn seasons from numbers to Winter, Spring, etc
bike_season <- bike %>%  
  mutate(
    season_name = case_when(
      season == 1 ~ "Winter",
      season == 2 ~ "Spring",
      season == 3 ~ "Summer",
      season == 4 ~ "Autumn"
                            ),
    
    #relevel the factor, otherwise it would have seasons in alphabetical order
    season_name = fct_relevel(season_name, "Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Autumn"),
  )

plot_season <- bike_season %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bikes_hired, y = season_name)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Highest Bike Usage in Summer", 
       subtitle = "Number of Bikes Hired by Season",
       x = "Number of Bikes Hired",
       y = "") +
  theme_economist_white()
plot_season
```


```{r}
# generate a new variable to turn day_of_week into Weekday and Weekend

bike_s_wk <- bike_season %>% 
  mutate(working_week = case_when(
         day_of_week == "Mon" ~ "Weekday",
         day_of_week == "Tue" ~ "Weekday",
         day_of_week == "Wed" ~ "Weekday",
         day_of_week == "Thu" ~ "Weekday",
         day_of_week == "Fri" ~ "Weekday",
         day_of_week == "Sat" ~ "Weekend",
         day_of_week == "Sun" ~ "Weekend"
                                )
        )

plot_working <- bike_s_wk %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bikes_hired, y = working_week)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_economist_white() +
  labs(title = "More Bikes Hired During the Week", 
       subtitle = "Potentially misleading as more weekdays than weekend-days", 
       x = "Number of Bikes Hired",
       y = "")

plot_working

```

Weekday hires are higher than weekend hires. However, this is to be expected as there are more 'week' days than 'weekend' days. Therefore, this plot is misleading, and we need to look at the average number of bikes hired for a weekday vs a weekend day in order for the numbers to be comparable.

```{r}


bike_av_working <- bike_s_wk %>%
   group_by(year, season_name, month, working_week) %>%
   summarise(bikes_hired) %>% 
   mutate(no_weekdays = count(working_week = "Weekday", na.rm = FALSE),
          no_weekend = count(working_week = "Weekend", na.rm = FALSE),
          average_bikes = case_when(
          working_week == "Weekday" ~ sum(bikes_hired)/no_weekday,
          working_week == "Weekend" ~ sum(bikes_hired)/no_weekend,
          TRUE ~ NA
                                     )
          ) %>% 
   group_by(season_name, working_week) %>% 
   summarise(average_bikes)

plot_working_av <- bike_av_working %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = average_bikes, y = working_week)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_economist_white() +
  labs(title = "", 
       subtitle = "", 
       x = "",
       y = "")

plot_working_av

```
